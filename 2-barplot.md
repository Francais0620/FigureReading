### 3.proportion
> b, The proportion of expressed and unexpressed copies of repetitive elements in each class during spermatogenesis. Of note, nearly half of rRNA genes are expressed in spermatogenic differentiation following the KIT+ spermatogonia stage.

### 4.experiment
> e,f, Dual-luciferase reporter assays. Relative fold changes in Nluc activity (Nluc/Fluc) were normalized to the negative Ctrl Nluc/Fluc ratio. Error bars represent mean ± s.e.m.: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; NS, not significant, unpaired t-tests. Three biological replicates were examined.
