### 1.DEGs

>d, Scatter plots showing differentially expressed TE copies in each transition. Differentially expressed copies of TEs were defined as those with a ≥2-fold change using DESeq2. We defined expressed TEs as those with baseMean values ≥2 in two successive stages.

> b, RNA-seq differential gene expression analysis: A-myb mutant versus heterozygous control testes at postnatal day 14 (P14). 1,705 genes evince significant changes in expression in A-myb mutants (blue circles); Padj < 0.01, binominal test with Benjamini–Hochberg correction. 103 enhancer-like ERV-adjacent genes are present amidst the 1,705 dysregulated genes in A-myb mutants (red circles); ***P = 2.43 × 10−31, hypergeometric test. 103 dysregulated ERV-adjacent genes (red circles) divided by 381 ERV-adjacent genes. 1,705 total dysregulated genes (blue circles) divided by 22,661 NCBI RefSeq genes (all genes, black circle).

### 2.Correlation

> f, Scatter plots showing the correlation between expressed TEs and expression of their adjacent genes. Red lines are regression lines (Pearson correlation, r).

### 3.Enrichment

> a, Scatter plots depicting observed ERV copy numbers in regions of accessible chromatin (within ATAC peak regions: y axis) versus the expected prevalence of ERV loci throughout the mouse genome (x axis) in the following ERV families in PSs: ERV1, ERVK and ERVL. Each dot represents a single type of ERV within a subfamily; red diamonds represent ERV types that exhibit significant enrichment in ERV copy numbers in regions of accessible chromatin (≥2-fold observed/expected enrichment: P < 0.05, binominal test; see Methods).
