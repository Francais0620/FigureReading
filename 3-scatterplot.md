### 1.DEGs

>d, Scatter plots showing differentially expressed TE copies in each transition. Differentially expressed copies of TEs were defined as those with a ≥2-fold change using DESeq2. We defined expressed TEs as those with baseMean values ≥2 in two successive stages.

### 2.Correlation

> f, Scatter plots showing the correlation between expressed TEs and expression of their adjacent genes. Red lines are regression lines (Pearson correlation, r).
