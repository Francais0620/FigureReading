### 1.Gene expression patterns between the two sets
> a, Cumulative distribution plot comparing the expression of the following gene sets in PSs: genes adjacent to enhancer-like ERVs (pink); all other NCBI RefSeq genes (black). Gene expression patterns differ significantly between the two sets: ***P < 0.001, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.

Importantly, these 1,452 genes were **highly expressed** in PSs in comparison to other genes in the genome


### 2.log2(fold change) patterns between the two sets（similar as the gene expression）

> e, RNA-seq analyses: cumulative distribution plots of log2(fold change) between KIT+ and PSs for the expression of genes adjacent to the enhancer-like elements ERV1, ERVK and ERVL, all with respect to other expressed genes (black). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; NS, not significant; Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.

Fig 7.e

We found that, although genes adjacent to H3K27ac-enriched ERV1s did not manifest significant gene expression changes after the mitosis-to-meiosis transition (Fig. 7e), genes adjacent to MER57E3s were **significantly activated** in PSs (Fig. 7e). Notably, genes adjacent to H3K27ac-enriched ERVKs tended to be associated with genes activated after the mitosis-to-meiosis transition compared to other genes in the human genome, while genes adjacent to H3K27ac-enriched ERVLs did not show such an association (Fig. 7e). These results suggest that a subset of ERVKs and ERV1s act as enhancers to activate meiotic genes in humans.
